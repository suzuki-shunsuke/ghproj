# ghproj

Add GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to GitHub Projects.

## Status

This project is still under development.
Please don't use this yet.

## Motivation

I manage a lot of OSS projects, so I have to handle a lot of issues and pull requests.
So I want to manage them using GitHub User and Organization Projects.

e.g.

- [suzuki-shunsuke](https://github.com/users/suzuki-shunsuke/projects/5)
- [aquaproj](https://github.com/orgs/aquaproj/projects/8)
- [lintnet](https://github.com/orgs/lintnet/projects/1)

By executing `ghproj` periodically by [GitHub Actions schedule event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule), you can add issues and projects to GitHub Projects automatically.

## Install

Coming soon.

## Usage

```sh
ghproj init # Scafold a configuration file ghproj.yaml
ghproj add # Add issues and pull requests to GitHub Projects
```

## GitHub Access token

GitHub classic personal access token is required.
The scope `read:org` and `project` are required.

> [!CAUTION]
> fine-grained personal access token is unavailable because it doesn't support GitHub Projects.
> https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/36441
> > There are also some APIs that do not yet support the fine-grained permission model, that we'll be adding support for in time:
> > - Packages
> > - Projects
> > - Notifications

> [!CAUTION]
> GitHub Access token generated by GitHub App is unavailable for GitHub User Project because the permission of GitHub User Project isn't supported
